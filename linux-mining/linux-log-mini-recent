    If CONFIG_BALLOON_COMPACTION=n balloon_page_insert() does not link pages
    with balloon and doesn't set PagePrivate flag, as a result
    balloon_page_dequeue() cannot get any pages because it thinks that all
    of them are isolated.  Without balloon compaction nobody can isolate
    ballooned pages.  It's safe to remove this check.

    zram: avoid NULL pointer access in concurrent situation
    
    There is a rare NULL pointer bug in mem_used_total_show() and
    mem_used_max_store() in concurrent situation, like this:
    
    zram is not initialized, process A is a mem_used_total reader which runs
    periodically, while process B try to init zram.
    
    	process A 				process B
      access meta, get a NULL value
    						init zram, done
      init_done() is true
      access meta->mem_pool, get a NULL pointer BUG
    
    This patch fixes this issue.

    mm/slab_common: don't check for duplicate cache names
    
    The SLUB cache merges caches with the same size and alignment and there
    was long standing bug with this behavior:
    
     - create the cache named "foo"
     - create the cache named "bar" (which is merged with "foo")
     - delete the cache named "foo" (but it stays allocated because "bar"
       uses it)
     - create the cache named "foo" again - it fails because the name "foo"
       is already used
    
    That bug was fixed in commit 694617474e33 ("slab_common: fix the check
    for duplicate slab names") by not warning on duplicate cache names when
    the SLUB subsystem is used.
    
    Recently, cache merging was implemented the with SLAB subsystem too, in
    12220dea07f1 ("mm/slab: support slab merge")).  Therefore we need stop
    checking for duplicate names even for the SLAB subsystem.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by removing the check.

    mm: memcontrol: fix missed end-writeback page accounting
    
    Commit 0a31bc97c80c ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge API") changed
    page migration to uncharge the old page right away.  The page is locked,
    unmapped, truncated, and off the LRU, but it could race with writeback
    ending, which then doesn't unaccount the page properly:
    
    test_clear_page_writeback()              migration
                                               wait_on_page_writeback()
      TestClearPageWriteback()
                                               mem_cgroup_migrate()
                                                 clear PCG_USED
      mem_cgroup_update_page_stat()
        if (PageCgroupUsed(pc))
          decrease memcg pages under writeback
    
      release pc->mem_cgroup->move_lock
    
    The per-page statistics interface is heavily optimized to avoid a
    function call and a lookup_page_cgroup() in the file unmap fast path,
    which means it doesn't verify whether a page is still charged before
    clearing PageWriteback() and it has to do it in the stat update later.
    
    Rework it so that it looks up the page's memcg once at the beginning of
    the transaction and then uses it throughout.  The charge will be
    verified before clearing PageWriteback() and migration can't uncharge
    the page as long as that is still set.  The RCU lock will protect the
    memcg past uncharge.
    
    As far as losing the optimization goes, the following test results are
    from a microbenchmark that maps, faults, and unmaps a 4GB sparse file
    three times in a nested fashion, so that there are two negative passes
    that don't account but still go through the new transaction overhead.
    There is no actual difference:
    
     old:     33.195102545 seconds time elapsed       ( +-  0.01% )
     new:     33.199231369 seconds time elapsed       ( +-  0.03% )
    
    The time spent in page_remove_rmap()'s callees still adds up to the
    same, but the time spent in the function itself seems reduced:
    
         # Children      Self  Command        Shared Object       Symbol
     old:     0.12%     0.11%  filemapstress  [kernel.kallsyms]   [k] page_remove_rmap
     new:     0.12%     0.08%  filemapstress  [kernel.kallsyms]   [k] page_remove_rmap

    memory-hotplug: clear pgdat which is allocated by bootmem in try_offline_node()
    
    When hot adding the same memory after hot removal, the following
    messages are shown:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 20 PID: 6 at mm/page_alloc.c:4968 free_area_init_node+0x3fe/0x426()

        ret_from_fork+0x7c/0xb0
    
    The detaled explanation is as follows:
    
    When hot removing memory, pgdat is set to 0 in try_offline_node().  But
    if the pgdat is allocated by bootmem allocator, the clearing step is
    skipped.
    
    And when hot adding the same memory, the uninitialized pgdat is reused.
    But free_area_init_node() checks wether pgdat is set to zero.  As a
    result, free_area_init_node() hits WARN_ON().
    
    This patch clears pgdat which is allocated by bootmem allocator in
    try_offline_node().
